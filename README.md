# MentorMe-FrontEnd

This app is meant to connect developers with mentors. 

This project was part of the group project under coding bootcamp and was supposed to be done in 2 weeks.

I suggested to build a single-page app where the profile page would slide in horizontally after signing in, replacing the home page. 
The simple suggested layout and slide nimation are presented under this repository. Not all the features have got developed because of limited time.

Front-end built with Bootstrap, SASS (SCSS in this case), Compass for compiling and JQuery.
